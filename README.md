An accountless app to organize events and invite people.

## Features

### Core Features

### Custom Fields (New!)
- **Dynamic Custom Questions**: Add custom fields when creating events

## Development

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Setup database: `rails db:setup`

5. Start server: `rails server`

### Database Migrations
